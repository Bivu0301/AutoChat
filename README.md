# AutoChat
Minecraft mod for automatically sending commands and using commands with keybindings


This mod is based on The-Fireplace Command-Keybindings Mod.

The idea behind the mod is the fact that is is very unnerving to enter a command
like gamemode or server specific commands again and again. Another idea is to 
send a command to a server where you for example have a shop which you have to 
promote with a command.

To use this mod, you have to put the mod in your mods folder and start minecraft. 
After that, you have to close minecraft (I hope I will fix this) and open your 
config folder, where you should find autochat.cfg. For every command you want to
use, enter this command below 'S:acl <'. You also can remove the default commands.
You can setup automatic commands with the lines 'S:acc=<command>' for your command,
'B:acca=<true/false>' to toggle if automatic messages is active and 'I:acct=<time
in minutes>' for the time interval. After restarting minecraft, your a able to enter
the keybindings.
!!!Important!!! The mod isn't working after editing the config right now. Restart 
Minecraft and hope I can fix it
